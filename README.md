 ### Why?
---
 I wanted a tool that allows people to track NFTs being minted in the gala ecosystem. 

 ### Prerequisites
 ---
 Some understanding of how ethereum wallets and web3 works. 

 The subgraph is currently being developed and deployed through [The Graph's](https://thegraph.com) [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), so that has to be setup first. 

 You will need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed. I've used v16.15.0.

 ### Installation
 ---
 To install this clone the repo, and run `npm install` at the root of the repo folder. This will install:

 * [@openzeppelin/subgraphs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/subgraphs)
 * [@graphprotocol/graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
 * [@graphprotocol/graph-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-ts)


 ### Build and deploy
 ---
 TBC.
